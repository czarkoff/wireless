     wwiirreelleessss scans for and configures wireless networks on OpenBSD.  It uses
     ifconfig(8) to do most of the heavy lifting and basically just interprets
     and applies scan results.

UUSSAAGGEE
     Just run wwiirreelleessss once to scan for known wireless LANs and configure the
     earliest network in the configuration file, for example:

           $ wireless
           ... wait a bit for scanning and configuration ...
           $ dhclient iwn0

     The result of the scan is also written to the file _/_t_m_p_/_n_w_-_a_p_s.  It
     contains one line for each access point with the following information:

           BSSID RSSI encrypted? known? SSID

     If necessary (see the _C_O_N_F_I_G_U_R_A_T_I_O_N section below), wwiirreelleessss will notify
     wpa_supplicant(8) of the newly established connection by calling

           wpa_cli reassoc

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
     This is an example configuration file:

           device iwn0
           verbose

           open   freifunk.paderborn.net
           802.1x eduroam
           wpa    "home network" thisismypassword

     There are three kinds of networks, ooppeenn, wwppaa and 880022..11xx.  All of these
     get an SSID as their first parameter.  wwppaa gets the password as the
     second parameter.  SSIDs and passwords which contain spaces can be
     enclosed in single or double quotes.  Regular string quoting rules apply:

           wpa Hello\ foo" 'I'm a password!'

     You can include files with the iinncclluuddee statement:

           include /home/user/.wireless.conf

     Macros can be set and used like this:

           mypw = "foobar! 1234#$"
           wpa nw1 $mypw
           wpa nw2 $mypw

     The priority of a network depends on the order of networks in the
     configuration file.  The earlier a network appears, the higher is its
     priority.  If an SSID is visible multiple times (such as in campus
     networks), the access point with the strongest RSSI is chosen.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     If the keyword vveerrbboossee is given in the configuration file, the name of
     the network that is being configured will be printed to the standard
     error stream.

     The keyword ddeebbuugg enables behaviour that helps debugging.  Its meaning
     will change without prior notice, so it should not be used outside of
     development.
